## Architecture
The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern to ensure clean separation of UI, business logic, and data. The architecture simplifies testing, maintenance, and scalability.

### Key Components:
- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic, handling the interaction with APIs or databases.
- **View**: The UI elements (screens like Login, Register, Dashboard) that are rendered to the user.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the Model and View, handling data transformations and user input.

---

## State Management
We use **Provider** to manage state across the app. Provider helps in separating the business logic from UI elements and allows real-time updates as the app interacts with various services.

### Why Provider?
- **Lightweight**: Reduces overhead and complexity.
- **Reactive**: Automatically updates the UI whenever the state changes.
- **Simple and Scalable**: Easy to manage state across different screens.
